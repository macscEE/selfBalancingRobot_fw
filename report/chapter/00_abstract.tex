This projects aims to design and implement a self-balancing robot using an ESP32 microcontroller
and an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor. The digital controller is based on a Proportional-Integral-Derivatived (PID) 
algorithm, which is tuned in order to achieve stability in the equilibrium position. The chassis of the robot is 3D printed,
and the robot is powered by two DC motors.
Throughout this work, the theoretical concepts behind the design of a self-balancing robot are explored,
including the mathematical modeling of the system, the design of the PID controller, and the implementation details.
At the end of this project, in the appendix section, the code for MATLAB/Simulink modelling and the microcontroller code provided.
