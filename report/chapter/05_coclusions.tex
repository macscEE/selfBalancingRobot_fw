\label{chap_05:conclusions}

In this report, we presented the design and implementation of a self-balancing robot using an ESP32 microcontroller 
and an MPU6050 IMU sensor. We modelled the system as an inverted pendulum and designed a PID controller to maintain balance. The physical implementation involved selecting appropriate hardware components,
designing a mechanical structure, and tuning the controller parameters experimentally.
The final robot successfully demonstrated the ability to balance itself and respond to disturbances, validating our modelling and control approach. 
Future work could involve exploring more advanced control strategies or implementation of a wireless interface for remote monitoring and control.

In this project we were able to apply theoretical concepts learned in class but also to gain practical
experience in analyzing and solving real-world engineering problems.
